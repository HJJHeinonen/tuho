## Local usage

   * Create virtual environment `python3 -m venv venv`
   * Activate virtual environment `source venv/bin/activate`
   * Upgrade pip `pip install --upgrade pip`
   * Install project dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   * Run the application `python3 run.py`
   * Use a web browser to navigate to `localhost:5000`

## Code style

Code style should follow style guides described in [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Linting can be done with flake8 (installed to venv) and imports can be sorted with isort.
